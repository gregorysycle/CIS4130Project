# Steam Reviews Predictor Project

This repository contains the files and code for analyzing and predicting whether a Steam review will recommend a game, using a dataset of Steam reviews. The project explores exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, modeling, and data visualization.

## Project Files
- **`cleaning.ipynb`**: Contains the code for cleaning the dataset. Includes handling missing values, standardizing column names, and preparing the data for feature engineering.
- **`feature_eng.ipynb`**: Includes the feature engineering process, such as encoding categorical variables, scaling continuous variables, and assembling features for machine learning models.
- **`steam_features_treatment.xlsx`**: A detailed table that outlines each column in the dataset, its data type, and the transformations applied during feature engineering.
- **`visualizations.ipynb`**: Code for generating various visualizations, such as heatmaps, bar charts, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves, to illustrate model performance and dataset characteristics.

## Overview
The project uses PySpark on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster for distributed data processing and machine learning. Logistic regression was used to predict whether a review recommends a game. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, imbalanced classes, and highly correlated features. Visualizations were created to explore feature relationships, evaluate class imbalance, and assess model performance.

Key outputs, including the cleaned data, feature-engineered dataset, and trained models, are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket for easy access and further analysis.
